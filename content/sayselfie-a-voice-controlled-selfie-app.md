I published [SaySelfie](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moduluslabs.sayselfie) app today on the Google Play store, so decided to blog about it. <!-- more -->

**What is a selfie?**
A selfie is a self-portrait photograph, typically taken with a hand-held digital camera or camera phone and usually shared on social networking sites.

**There are lot of selfie apps on the play store so why another?**
Usually, you take a selfie using the in-built camera app by tapping on the screen. This requires your concentration on the tap rather than your selfie especially if you are using the primary camera. 

The best thing about SaySelfie is that it doesn't requires an internet connection. So, if your are at remote places with no internet connection, you should be able to take a selfie by using the voice recognition technology.

**Just Say Selfie and share it.**

Features

 1. Voice controlled Selfie app.
 2. No internet connection required.
