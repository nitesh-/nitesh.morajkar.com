I decided to write my first post to share my experience about importance of blogging for a programmer.

Well, you are a programmer and you need to tell the world, what all things you are working on. This helps you keep connected with programmers around the world. Also, it helps you to build communication skills which is most important for a programmer.<!-- more -->

If you use an API on your project, tweet or email the company telling them what you thought about their API. When you receive a prize at a hackathon, show your appreciation by sending them a nice tweet, or write a blog post about it. Try to make each blog post the best ever. The biggest benefit of a healthy communication is that it makes you responsible for your projects.

While writing about your post, you might get some new ideas or find a different approach for a problem definition. Readers can give feedback for your project.

As we live in an Open source community(mostof us), we should be sharing our knowledge and experience.
